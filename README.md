# LiquidStakeDAO

Liquid (transferable) stakes for HEX with optional shared reward pool.
Basically this allows you to stake HEX with the contract and get a LiquidStake
NFT for that. The nice thing is that the Token ID of this NFT equals the HEX
Stake ID.

The code for this is minimal and can fit on a single screen: [LiquidStake.sol](./contracts/LiquidStake.sol)

You can get a good understanding of this by reading the [test case](tests/test_integration.py#85).

## Main Contract Goals

* No admin key
* Unstoppable, unpausable, no governance functionality
* Test suite
* Audited (post-launch by donations?)

## Optional Rewards Pool

This contract can also be deployed with a Rewards pool. Users of the
LiquidStakeDAO (LSD) token could claim their portion of the fees generated by
the main contract.

## Optional Farming

In order to distribute the LSD token, this repository also includes an optional
farming contract: The system can have a fair launch with all LSD tokens
distributed to users of the protocol (no team allocation etc.). How is this
possible? By staking your LiquidStake NFT into the farming contract and get
rewarded with LSD. The amount decreases every month so the earlier adopters are
still able to get an advantage.

## Run tests

Run tests like this:

    brownie test --network mainnet-fork
